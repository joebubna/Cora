# Cora
Cora is a lightweight MVC PHP framework for rapid app development.

To try it:

* Download all the files and throw them in a folder within your web directory.
* Change the line at the top of .htaccess that says "/cora" to match the name of the folder you threw the files in.
* Look through cora/config/config.php and change anything that needs to be changed.
