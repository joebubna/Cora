The easiest is going to be just using Composer, \nthe 2nd easiest would be to clone the Github repository, and lastly you could just download the ZIP off Github.\nSee below for instructions for each. First before you do that though, make sure you have the needed supporting software\nrunning on your machine.\n\n\nSetting Up A Computer For PHP Development\n\n\nThroughout this documentation there are a few pieces of software which are assumed to be on your computer. If you don't have these programs,\nthen you'll need to get them if you want to follow along with any examples we give.\n\n\nRequired: \"AMP\" stack\n \n\nFirstly, it is necessary you have some sort of \"AMP\" stack available on your computer. If you aren't familiar with this term, it's usually short for\nApache+MySQL+PHP, but is used as a catch-all term for having a web server (like Apache), a database solution (such as MySQL),\nand a programming language (such as PHP or Python). If you are just getting into development work and do not already have this\nsetup available on your computer, see below for some recommendations on getting that in place:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Windows or Linux, we'd recommend trying \nXAMPP\n.\n\n\nIf you are using a Mac, we'd recommend trying \nMAMP\n.\n\n\n\n\nRequired: Git\n \n\nGit is a type of version control software. Its most important feature is it allows multiple developers \nto work on a project at the same time by automatically (mostly) combining the code written and allowing \neach developer to grab the latest version of the codebase when someone else submits changes. However, \nit's also highly useful when working alone too. It will allow you to easily undo code if you break something \nand want to return your project to an earlier point in time, it will allow you to work on multiple in-progress \nnew features simultaneously without worrying about one partially finished feature screwing things up for another piece, etc.\nSo it's essential if you end up working in a team, and useful if you're by yourself, and overall a REALLY good habit to get used\nto using it. Pretty much all software developers use Git nowadays.\n\n\nTo install Git:\n\n\n\n\nYour best bet is probably to download Github Desktop which includes a copy of Git with it: \nGithub Desktop\n.\n\n\nAlternatively you can check out the installation options \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nRequired: Terminal/Powershell Window\n \n\nGraphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are what made computing friendly for the average Joe Shmo and lead us to the digitally connected society \nwe have today. However, if you're planning on getting into development work, you'll find it much easier to do if you get familar with using a terminal.\nA terminal is just a text interface where you can give your computer commands. If you want to learn more about how to use terminals, try Googling \n\"beginnners guide to using a terminal\" and some results will pop up.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Windows\n: Search your computer for \"Powershell\". Then make a shortcut to Windows Powershell where you can easily access it. It's important to note that the Git install adds Unix style commands to it which you will need to follow along with our tutorials - SO MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL GIT from the instructions above!\n\n\nUsing a Mac\n: We'd recommend you download \niTerm2\n.\n\n\nUsing Linux\n: Let's be honest... you don't need me to tell you how to access the terminal. \ncough\n likey Ctrl+Alt+T \ncough\n\n\n\n\nHighly Recommended: Composer\n \n\nComposer is a dependancy manager that helps you install and update software libraries (aka code written by other people that\nyou end up using in your project). This includes Cora itself! You can use Composer as an easy way to install Cora (instructions in the \nInstallation Using Composer section below) and update to the latest version of Cora later on down the road if a newer release comes out\nafter you've already started your project (see \nHERE\n for details on using Composer with Cora).\n\n\n\n\nTo download Composer go here \nhttps://getcomposer.org/\n.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Using Composer\n\n\nOpen up a Terminal window and navigate to the location where you'd like to put the Cora folder that holds the project files. \nIf you are installing to your root web directory, typically this will be named \"htdocs\" or \"public_html\". \n\n\nMac\n\n\nFor instance: if you're using a Mac and installed MAMP, you probably want to navigate to\n\n\ncd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nIf you're using Windows and installed XAMPP, you likely want to go to\n\n\ncd C:\\xampp\\htdocs\n\n\n\n\nGet Cora\n\n\nOnce you are at the location you want to install Cora to, type:\n\n\nphp composer.phar create-project cora/cora\n\n\n\n\nOR if you installed Composer globally as part of your PATH (which we'd recommend doing if you know how) type:\n\n\ncomposer create-project cora/cora\n\n\n\n\nThat's it!\n If all went well you should now have a folder named \"Cora\" in your specified directory.\n\n\nInstallation Using Git\n\n\nOpen up a Terminal window and navigate to the location where you'd like to put the Cora folder that holds the project files. \nIf you are installing to your root web directory, typically this will be named \"htdocs\" or \"public_html\". \nFor instance: if you're using a Mac and installed MAMP, you probably want to navigate to\n\n\ncd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using Windows and installed XAMPP, you likely want to go to\n\n\ncd C:\\xampp\\htdocs\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are at the location you want to install Cora to, type:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/joebubna/Cora.git\n\n\n\n\nThat's it!\n If all went well you should now have a folder named \"Cora\" in your specified directory.\n\n\nInstallation From ZIP File\n\n\nGo to \nhttps://github.com/joebubna/Cora\n and click the \"Download ZIP\" button on the right hand side\nof the page. Use your Finder or File Explorer in your OS and go to your web directory (probably either \"C:\\xampp\\htdocs\" if you're on Windows\nor \"/Applications/MAMP/htdocs\" if you're on a Mac).

Test by going to \n\n\nhttp://localhost/cora\n\n\n\n\nIf it loads something, then Cora is working. If it doesn't work, then you probably either need to enable .htaccess files usage in apache, \nenable mod_rewrite in apache, you changed the name of something before reaching this article, or you didn't install Cora to your root web directory.\nIf you are using one of the suggested AMP packages from the installation page, everything should theoretically be working though.\n\n\nIf you didn't install Cora into your root directory, no worries, you'll just need to run through the following config instructions first before\nthings will work.\n\n\nStep 1: Change the Name of the Directory to Match Your Project\n\n\nBy default, the folder for Cora that got copied into your web directory should be named \"cora\". Just a guess, but you probably want to change\nthis to match the name of the project you plan on building. If for instance you want to create an app called \"My Awesome Site\", go ahead and rename\nthat cora directory to \"MyAwesomeSite\". \n\n\nStep 2: Change Your .htaccess File to Match Your Directory Name\n\n\nContinuing our \"MyAwesomeSite\" example, next you would need to open up the hidden \".htaccess\" file located within that directory and change the third line \ndown to:\n\n\nRewriteBase /MyAwesomeSite\n\n\n\n\nOR, if you installed Cora into a subfolder within your web directory, then you will need to include the full path from your root like so:\n\n\nRewriteBase /someFolder/MyAwesomeSite\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Note\n \n\nWhile on this topic, it should be noted that using a .htaccess file does have a performance cost. If you are planning on making an enterprise level app\nthat serves a large number of users, you'll probably want to eventually get rid of the .htaccess file and instead place the mod_rewrite rules into your server config.\nDoing this is beyond the scope of this documentation, but it's just something of which you should be aware.\n\n\nStep 3: Update the Site_Url in Your Config\n\n\nNext you need to open up the \"cora/config/config.php\" file in your project. The full path to this file should look something similar to this:\n\n\n/htdocs/MyAwesomeSite/cora/config/config.php\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing you should see are some commented out examples of commonly changed options like:\n\n\n#$config['debug'] = true;\n#$config['debugHide'] = false;\n#$config['site_url'] = '/cora/';\n#$config['cora_extension'] = 'MyApp';\n\n\n\n\nNote that this config file overrides any defaults that are located in \n\n\n/htdocs/MyAwesomeSite/vendor/cora/cora-framework/system/config/config.php\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and uncomment the line for 'site_url' and change the value to match your new directory name. If your project is embedded in\nsub-directories, you do not need to include the full path, just the name of the folder the Cora project files are within. Example:\n\n\n$config['site_url'] = '/MyAwesomeSite/';\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create Your Project Controller\n\n\nGo ahead and open up any of the example controllers that are included in the controllers directory. The class declaration should look something like:\n\n\nclass Articles extends \\MyApp {\n\n\n\n\nAnytime you create a new controller, you want to have it extend from some \"base\" controller, which in the case above is \"MyApp\". This allows you to\nhave shared data and methods across all your controllers when necessary. Although you can leave the name of this base controller as \"MyApp\" if you want to,\nwe're guessing you'll probably want to change this to something more offical sounding that matches the name of your project.\n\n\nNavigate to the \"cora/extensions/MyApp.php\" file in your project and make a copy of it, renaming the copy to \"MyAwesomeSite.php\". After you do this, make sure you open\nthe file and change the class name to MyAwesomeSite too. It should look like the following:\n\n\nclass MyAwesomeSite extends Cora\n\n\n\n\nThen go back and edit the Articles controller to extend from your new base class. Note that once you complete this setup guide and confirm everything is working, you'll then be able to go back and delete the MyApp file later if you want.\n\n\nStep 5: Make All Controllers Extend From Project Controller\n\n\nNow that you have your base project controller ready, you need to open up each of the controllers under your \"controllers\" directory and change them\nto extend from your new base controller instead of MyApp. They should all follow this format:\n\n\nclass Articles extends \\MyAwesomeSite {\n\n\n\n\nFinished!!!\n\n\nThat's it! You should be able to run your project and play around with it and the included demos now. \nIf you are an experienced user who wants to know about the advanced configuration options within Cora, or how Cora can be\nincorporated into an existing software project, click \nhere\n to view the advanced configuration tutorial.\nOtherwise, click below to continue on to the introductory tutorial to help you get acquainted with Cora.\n\n\n\n\nNext: Introduction to Cora",

This allows you to\nhave shared data and methods across all your controllers when necessary. Although you can leave the name of this base controller as \"MyApp\" if you want to,\nwe're guessing you'll probably want to change this to something more offical sounding that matches the name of your project.  Navigate to the \"cora/extensions/MyApp.php\" file in your project and make a copy of it, renaming the copy to \"MyAwesomeSite.php\". After you do this, make sure you open\nthe file and change the class name to MyAwesomeSite too. It should look like the following:  class MyAwesomeSite extends Cora  Then go back and edit the Articles controller to extend from your new base class. Note that once you complete this setup guide and confirm everything is working, you'll then be able to go back and delete the MyApp file later if you want.",
