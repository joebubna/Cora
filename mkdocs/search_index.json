The easiest is going to be just using Composer, \nthe 2nd easiest would be to clone the Github repository, and lastly you could just download the ZIP off Github.\nSee below for instructions for each. First before you do that though, make sure you have the needed supporting software\nrunning on your machine.\n\n\nSetting Up A Computer For PHP Development\n\n\nThroughout this documentation there are a few pieces of software which are assumed to be on your computer. If you don't have these programs,\nthen you'll need to get them if you want to follow along with any examples we give.\n\n\nRequired: \"AMP\" stack\n \n\nFirstly, it is necessary you have some sort of \"AMP\" stack available on your computer. If you aren't familiar with this term, it's usually short for\nApache+MySQL+PHP, but is used as a catch-all term for having a web server (like Apache), a database solution (such as MySQL),\nand a programming language (such as PHP or Python). If you are just getting into development work and do not already have this\nsetup available on your computer, see below for some recommendations on getting that in place:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Windows or Linux, we'd recommend trying \nXAMPP\n.\n\n\nIf you are using a Mac, we'd recommend trying \nMAMP\n.\n\n\n\n\nRequired: Git\n \n\nGit is a type of version control software. Its most important feature is it allows multiple developers \nto work on a project at the same time by automatically (mostly) combining the code written and allowing \neach developer to grab the latest version of the codebase when someone else submits changes. However, \nit's also highly useful when working alone too. It will allow you to easily undo code if you break something \nand want to return your project to an earlier point in time, it will allow you to work on multiple in-progress \nnew features simultaneously without worrying about one partially finished feature screwing things up for another piece, etc.\nSo it's essential if you end up working in a team, and useful if you're by yourself, and overall a REALLY good habit to get used\nto using it. Pretty much all software developers use Git nowadays.\n\n\nTo install Git:\n\n\n\n\nYour best bet is probably to download Github Desktop which includes a copy of Git with it: \nGithub Desktop\n.\n\n\nAlternatively you can check out the installation options \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nRequired: Terminal/Powershell Window\n \n\nGraphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are what made computing friendly for the average Joe Shmo and lead us to the digitally connected society \nwe have today. However, if you're planning on getting into development work, you'll find it much easier to do if you get familar with using a terminal.\nA terminal is just a text interface where you can give your computer commands. If you want to learn more about how to use terminals, try Googling \n\"beginnners guide to using a terminal\" and some results will pop up.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Windows\n: Search your computer for \"Powershell\". Then make a shortcut to Windows Powershell where you can easily access it. It's important to note that the Git install adds Unix style commands to it which you will need to follow along with our tutorials - SO MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL GIT from the instructions above!\n\n\nUsing a Mac\n: We'd recommend you download \niTerm2\n.\n\n\nUsing Linux\n: Let's be honest... you don't need me to tell you how to access the terminal. \ncough\n likey Ctrl+Alt+T \ncough\n\n\n\n\nHighly Recommended: Composer\n \n\nComposer is a dependancy manager that helps you install and update software libraries (aka code written by other people that\nyou end up using in your project). This includes Cora itself! You can use Composer as an easy way to install Cora (instructions in the \nInstallation Using Composer section below) and update to the latest version of Cora later on down the road if a newer release comes out\nafter you've already started your project (see \nHERE\n for details on using Composer with Cora).\n\n\n\n\nTo download Composer go here \nhttps://getcomposer.org/\n.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Using Composer\n\n\nOpen up a Terminal window and navigate to the location where you'd like to put the Cora folder that holds the project files. \nIf you are installing to your root web directory, typically this will be named \"htdocs\" or \"public_html\". \n\n\nMac\n\n\nFor instance: if you're using a Mac and installed MAMP, you probably want to navigate to\n\n\ncd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nIf you're using Windows and installed XAMPP, you likely want to go to\n\n\ncd C:\\xampp\\htdocs\n\n\n\n\nGet Cora\n\n\nOnce you are at the location you want to install Cora to, type:\n\n\nphp composer.phar create-project cora/cora\n\n\n\n\nOR if you installed Composer globally as part of your PATH (which we'd recommend doing if you know how) type:\n\n\ncomposer create-project cora/cora\n\n\n\n\nThat's it!\n If all went well you should now have a folder named \"Cora\" in your specified directory.\n\n\nInstallation Using Git\n\n\nOpen up a Terminal window and navigate to the location where you'd like to put the Cora folder that holds the project files. \nIf you are installing to your root web directory, typically this will be named \"htdocs\" or \"public_html\". \nFor instance: if you're using a Mac and installed MAMP, you probably want to navigate to\n\n\ncd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using Windows and installed XAMPP, you likely want to go to\n\n\ncd C:\\xampp\\htdocs\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are at the location you want to install Cora to, type:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/joebubna/Cora.git\n\n\n\n\nThat's it!\n If all went well you should now have a folder named \"Cora\" in your specified directory.\n\n\nInstallation From ZIP File\n\n\nGo to \nhttps://github.com/joebubna/Cora\n and click the \"Download ZIP\" button on the right hand side\nof the page. Use your Finder or File Explorer in your OS and go to your web directory (probably either \"C:\\xampp\\htdocs\" if you're on Windows\nor \"/Applications/MAMP/htdocs\" if you're on a Mac).

Test by going to \n\n\nhttp://localhost/cora\n\n\n\n\nIf it loads something, then Cora is working. If it doesn't work, then you probably either need to enable .htaccess files usage in apache, \nenable mod_rewrite in apache, you changed the name of something before reaching this article, or you didn't install Cora to your root web directory.\nIf you are using one of the suggested AMP packages from the installation page, everything should theoretically be working though.\n\n\nIf you didn't install Cora into your root directory, no worries, you'll just need to run through the following config instructions first before\nthings will work.\n\n\nStep 1: Change the Name of the Directory to Match Your Project\n\n\nBy default, the folder for Cora that got copied into your web directory should be named \"cora\". Just a guess, but you probably want to change\nthis to match the name of the project you plan on building. If for instance you want to create an app called \"My Awesome Site\", go ahead and rename\nthat cora directory to \"MyAwesomeSite\". \n\n\nStep 2: Change Your .htaccess File to Match Your Directory Name\n\n\nContinuing our \"MyAwesomeSite\" example, next you would need to open up the hidden \".htaccess\" file located within that directory and change the third line \ndown to:\n\n\nRewriteBase /MyAwesomeSite\n\n\n\n\nOR, if you installed Cora into a subfolder within your web directory, then you will need to include the full path from your root like so:\n\n\nRewriteBase /someFolder/MyAwesomeSite\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Note\n \n\nWhile on this topic, it should be noted that using a .htaccess file does have a performance cost. If you are planning on making an enterprise level app\nthat serves a large number of users, you'll probably want to eventually get rid of the .htaccess file and instead place the mod_rewrite rules into your server config.\nDoing this is beyond the scope of this documentation, but it's just something of which you should be aware.\n\n\nStep 3: Update the Site_Url in Your Config\n\n\nNext you need to open up the \"cora/config/config.php\" file in your project. The full path to this file should look something similar to this:\n\n\n/htdocs/MyAwesomeSite/cora/config/config.php\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing you should see are some commented out examples of commonly changed options like:\n\n\n#$config['debug'] = true;\n#$config['debugHide'] = false;\n#$config['site_url'] = '/cora/';\n#$config['cora_extension'] = 'MyApp';\n\n\n\n\nNote that this config file overrides any defaults that are located in \n\n\n/htdocs/MyAwesomeSite/vendor/cora/cora-framework/system/config/config.php\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and uncomment the line for 'site_url' and change the value to match your new directory name. If your project is embedded in\nsub-directories, you do not need to include the full path, just the name of the folder the Cora project files are within. Example:\n\n\n$config['site_url'] = '/MyAwesomeSite/';\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create Your Project Controller\n\n\nGo ahead and open up any of the example controllers that are included in the controllers directory. The class declaration should look something like:\n\n\nclass Articles extends \\MyApp {\n\n\n\n\nAnytime you create a new controller, you want to have it extend from some \"base\" controller, which in the case above is \"MyApp\". This allows you to\nhave shared data and methods across all your controllers when necessary. Although you can leave the name of this base controller as \"MyApp\" if you want to,\nwe're guessing you'll probably want to change this to something more offical sounding that matches the name of your project.\n\n\nNavigate to the \"cora/extensions/MyApp.php\" file in your project and make a copy of it, renaming the copy to \"MyAwesomeSite.php\". After you do this, make sure you open\nthe file and change the class name to MyAwesomeSite too. It should look like the following:\n\n\nclass MyAwesomeSite extends Cora\n\n\n\n\nThen go back and edit the Articles controller to extend from your new base class. Note that once you complete this setup guide and confirm everything is working, you'll then be able to go back and delete the MyApp file later if you want.\n\n\nStep 5: Make All Controllers Extend From Project Controller\n\n\nNow that you have your base project controller ready, you need to open up each of the controllers under your \"controllers\" directory and change them\nto extend from your new base controller instead of MyApp. They should all follow this format:\n\n\nclass Articles extends \\MyAwesomeSite {\n\n\n\n\nFinished!!!\n\n\nThat's it! You should be able to run your project and play around with it and the included demos now. \nIf you are an experienced user who wants to know about the advanced configuration options within Cora, or how Cora can be\nincorporated into an existing software project, click \nhere\n to view the advanced configuration tutorial.\nOtherwise, click below to continue on to the introductory tutorial to help you get acquainted with Cora.\n\n\n\n\nNext: Introduction to Cora",

For examples see the syntactially identical orWhere() method.\n\n\norderBy() method\n\n\nPurpose:\n \n\nThe orderBy() method is for ordering the returned results from your query.\n\n\nFormat:\n \n\n\n// sort_direction = DESC (descending) | ASC (ascending)\norderBy(column_name, sort_direction)\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n \n\n\n// Specifying a single column to order by...\n$db ->orderBy('name', 'ASC')\n\n// Specifying multiple columns to order by...\n$db ->orderBy('users.name', 'DESC')\n    ->orderBy('locations.name', 'DESC')\n\n\n\n\nlimit() method\n\n\nPurpose:\n \n\nThe limit() method is for limiting the number of returned results from a query.\n\n\nFormat:\n   \n\n\nlimit(number)\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n   \n\n\n// Limit the number of result rows to 10\n$db ->limit(10)\n\n\n\n\noffset() method\n\n\nPurpose:\n \n\nThe offset() method is for specifying how many result rows should be skipped when returning a query.\nIt's most commonly used in conjunction with limit() to perform pagination.\n\n\nFormat:\n   \n\n\noffset(number)\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n   \n\n\n// Skip returning the first 10 results from a query's result set.\n$db ->offset(10)\n\n// Return results 11-20 from a large result set\n$db ->limit(10)\n    ->offset(10)\n\n// Return results 21-30 from a large result set\n$db ->limit(10)\n    ->offset(20)",

            "text": "Cora's Validation class\n\n\nThe Validate class is for checking that data matches a set of restrictions. For instance, if you have a form for users to submit and want to require that they fill out the 'email' field and enter something that at least looks like a valid email, Validate can help with that. It's main usage will typically be for validating form submissions, but it can be used to validate any data you pass in.\n\n\nNote that the Validate class must be called from a Controller as any errors returned will be loaded into that controller's \"errors\" data member!\n\n\nFront-end vs. Back-end Validation:\n   \n\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with form validation, it's worth mentioning that front-end Javascript validators are easier to setup and can save you that tiny bit of server processing power if efficiency is important. The main drawbacks of front-end validation is that it can be \nbypassed\n (important to know if you didn't already know that) and you have to setup a special API in order to do things like check if a Username is already taken, etc. For this reason, for validation that is even remotely important, you should either use back-end validation like this Validation class provides, or use both a front-end validator and this class on the backend (in-case a user bypasses the front-end validation code).\n\n\nExample Usage\n\n\n// This is a method within a controller.\npublic function createPOST()\n{\n    // Load Validate\n    $this->load->library('Validate', $this, true);  \n\n    // Define validation rules for form inputs.\n    $this->Validate->rule('username', 'required|max_length[55]|trim');\n    $this->Validate->rule('email', 'required|valid_email');\n    $this->Validate->rule('password', 'required');\n    $this->Validate->rule('password2', 'required|matches[password]');\n\n    // Initiate validation\n    if ($this->Validate->run()) {        \n        // Form validation was successful! Do stuff with data.\n    }\n    else {      \n        // The form validation failed!\n        // Redisplay the form to the user so they can fix the errors.\n        $this->create();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using the Cora demo project, you can find an example form being used at:\n\n\n/controllers/articles/controller.News.php\n\n\n\n\nWhich can be navigated to in your web browser by going to:\n\n\nlocalhost/myProject/articles/news/create/\n\n\n\n\nTypical Usage Steps\n\n\nUsage typically includes the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nLoad the validation class.\n\n\nDefine any custom validation checks you need.\n\n\nApply validation checks to pieces of data by defining the rules that data must obey.\n\n\nRun the validation checker.\n\n\nDisplay any errors to the user and repopulate the form they submitted if necessary.\n\n\n\n\nLoading\n\n\nAlthough you can certainly load Validate like any other class, the recommended way of loading it into your controller is to use the Load class. The load class handles some references stuff for you automatically which I'll explain later. To use the Load class to get Validate, add the following to your controller:\n\n\n// Recommended way of setup\n$this->load->library('Validate', $this, true);\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that we're specifying that we want to load the Validate class as the first parameter should make sense. What you're probably wondering about is what the other two parameters do. For the 2nd parameter we're passing a reference to the current controller; Validate uses this reference to load any validation errors generated into that controller's \"$this->errors\" data member. The third parameter being true tells the Load class to create a reference in the calling controller to Validate for you. In other words it does the equivalent of this:\n\n\n$this->data->Validate = new \\Validate($this);\n\n\n\n\nOk... but why do you need a reference to Validate in the controller like that? Because in order to use Validate's form repopulation methods within a View file, you need a reference to Validate in the data you pass to that view! If this doesn't make sense at the moment, don't worry about it. You might understand it better once you see usage examples below, and even if you don't, it's not important so long as you follow the recommended way of loading specified above.\n\n\nBuilt-In Validation Checks\n\n\nThere are a few built-in validation checks for common concerns. They are:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n'Check' Name\n\n    \nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nrequired\n\n    \nSpecifies that a value must be entered for this field (specifying form fields that MUST be filled out).\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nvalid_email\n\n    \nSpecifies that the value must match a valid email pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nmatches[name]\n\n    \nSpecifies that this field must match the one specified in the brackets (I.E. does 'password' match 'password2'?)\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nmin_length[x]\n\n    \nSpecifies that this field must be at least X characters in length.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nmax_length[x]\n\n    \nSpecifies that this field must be at most X characters in length.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \ntrim\n\n    \nTrims whitespace from the beginning and end of the field. Doesn't ever fail, this is just a utility method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, while these work great for general purpose kinda validations, there might be times when you need to check something specific such as \"Is this username already taken?\" In those scenarios you will need to define your own validation \"check\" which can then be applied to a field just like the built-in ones.\n\n\nCustom Validation Checks\n\n\nCustom validation checks allow you to call a method from whatever class you want within your app and pass that method the input value. Below is an example of us defining a custom check that calls a method named \"isNameAvailable\" within our User class, so that we can check if a username a person wants is available when they register. (Note: The 4th parameter is the error message if the name isn't available.)\n\n\nDefining a custom validation check is easy. Here's an example:\n\n\n// Define the check\n$this->Validate->def('userNameAvailable', 'User','isNameAvailable', 'Username already taken.');\n\n// Use the check in a rule\n$this->Validate->rule('username', 'required|userNameAvailable');\n\n\n\n\nThe \"def\" method takes 4 required parameters, and an optional 5th one. Below is the function signature and a description of what each parameter does:\n\n\n$this->Validate->def($checkName, $class, $method, $errorMessageOnFailure, $passingResponse);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nParameter Name\n\n    \nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n$checkName\n\n    \nThis is the name of your new custom check. It's what you will include when defining your data rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n$class\n\n    \nThe class within your app that we want to invoke for this custom check.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n$method\n\n    \nThe method within that Class that we want to call and pass our input to.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n$errorMessageOnFailure\n\n    \nThe message to display if this check does not pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n$passingResponse\n\n    \n[OPTIONAL] Custom check methods are expected to return a TRUE or FALSE response when given the form input. This specifies which response is the passing one! By default this is set to TRUE. See below for examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the optional 5th parameter when defining a custom check needs a little explaining. Basically, whatever methods you call for custom checks are expected to return True or False when given a certain input. However, which response \"passes\" the check, depends on how the method is written - and is why this optional 5th parameter exists. See the examples below:\n\n\n// Example 1 - A 'TRUE' value means the check passes.\n// Check passes if 'isNameAvailable' returns TRUE.\n$this->Validate->def('userNameAvailable', 'User','isNameAvailable', 'Username already taken.', TRUE);\n$this->Validate->rule('username', 'required|userNameAvailable');\n\n// Example 2 - A 'FALSE' value means the check passes.\n// Check passes if 'isNameTaken' returns FALSE.\n$this->Validate->def('userNameIsTaken', 'User','isNameTaken', 'Username already taken.', FALSE);\n$this->Validate->rule('username', 'required|userNameTaken');\n\n\n\n\nHuman Readable Field Names\n\n\nIf you have a form input that has a name which isn't super user friendly, you can replace the name of the input in any error messages with a custom specified name by specifying an optional 3rd parameter when making your rules:\n\n\n$this->Validate->rule('password2', 'required|matches[password]', 'Password Confirmation');\n\n\n\n\nThis will result in the following error message if validation fails: \n\n\n\"Password Confirmation does not match password!\"\n\n\nDisplaying errors\n\n\nFrom within a View, the array of errors can be found within the \"$errors\" variable. They can be displayed by using the Load class' \"repeat\" method (this is the easiest way), or else you can manually iterate over the errors. Both methods are shown below:\n\n\nRepeat Method:\n   \n\n\n// Parameter 1 = Array to iterate over.\n// Parameter 2 = Tag to surround array items with.\n// Parameter 3 = CSS class to attach to each item.\n// Parameter 4 = Tag to wrap entire repeat block with.\n// Parameter 5 = CSS class to attach to wrapper.\n<?= $this->repeat($errors, 'li', 'item', 'ul', 'list'); ?>\n\n\n\n\nGenerates:\n\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n    <li class=\"item\">Error 1</li>\n    <li class=\"item\">Error 2</li>\n    ...\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\nOR\n\n\nManual Method:\n   \n\n\n<?php if (isset($errors)) { ?>\n    <ul>\n        <?php foreach ($errors as $error) { ?>\n            <li><?= $error; ?></li>\n        <?php } ?>\n    </ul>\n<?php } ?>\n\n\n\n\nRepopulating Forms\n\n\nThere's three methods in the Validate class that are designed to help you repopulate a form if validation fails.\n\n\n// For repopulating text boxes and text areas.\n$Validate->setField($fieldName, $defaultValue = '')\n\n// For repopulating check boxes and ratio buttons.\n$Validate->setCheckbox($fieldName, $fieldValue, $checkedByDefault = FALSE)\n\n// For repopulating select boxes.\n$Validate->setSelect($fieldName, $fieldValue, $selectedByDefault = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nThese need to be echo'ed inside the HTML tag in question. See below for an example of a complete form with errors display and repopulation of the fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n<h1>Create Article</h1>\n<form method=\"POST\">\n\n    <?= $this->repeat($errors, 'li', 'item', 'ul', 'list'); ?>\n\n\n    <div>\n        <h3>Title:</h3>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"title\" value=\"<?= $Validate->setField('title', 'test'); ?>\">\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <h3>Content:</h3>\n        <textarea name=\"content\"><?= $Validate->setField('content'); ?></textarea>\n    </div>\n    <br>\n\n    <div>\n        Item 1:<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"mycheck[]\" value=\"1\" <?=$Validate->setCheckbox('mycheck', '1');?>>\n        <br>\n        Item 2:<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"mycheck[]\" value=\"2\" <?=$Validate->setCheckbox('mycheck', '2', true);?>>\n    </div>\n    <br>\n\n    <div>\n        <select name=\"myselect\">\n            <option value=\"Option One\" <?= $Validate->setSelect('myselect', 'Option One'); ?> >One</option>\n            <option value=\"Option Two\" <?= $Validate->setSelect('myselect', 'Option Two', true); ?> >Two</option>\n            <option value=\"Option Three\" <?= $Validate->setSelect('myselect', 'Option Three'); ?> >Three</option>\n        </select>\n    </div>\n    <br>\n\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n</form>",

The main drawbacks of front-end validation is that it can be  bypassed  (important to know if you didn't already know that) and you have to setup a special API in order to do things like check if a Username is already taken, etc. For this reason, for validation that is even remotely important, you should either use back-end validation like this Validation class provides, or use both a front-end validator and this class on the backend (in-case a user bypasses the front-end validation code).",

For the 2nd parameter we're passing a reference to the current controller; Validate uses this reference to load any validation errors generated into that controller's \"$this->errors\" data member. The third parameter being true tells the Load class to create a reference in the calling controller to Validate for you. In other words it does the equivalent of this:  $this->data->Validate = new \\Validate($this);  Ok... but why do you need a reference to Validate in the controller like that? Because in order to use Validate's form repopulation methods within a View file, you need a reference to Validate in the data you pass to that view!

What can a Turing Machine based computer compute? What can\u2019t a turing machine based computer compute? \nWhat kind of problems are impractical to compute for anything other than really small data sets? We\u2019ll briefly explore these questions below.\n\n\nStraight up Non-Computable\n\n\nLet's first talk about problems that current computers simply cannot compute.\n\n\nThe Halting Problem\n\n\nIf you are software developer, you undoubtably have encountered infinite loops. Unlike interpretted\nlanguages such as PHP which will time out, lower level languages such as C++ will just keep running in an infinite loop forever if one exists.\nWith this in mind, it may seem like a good idea for someone to create a debugging program that detects those kinds of run-time errors in apps.\nHowever, you may be surprised to learn that \nthe reason why no such program exists is because it's impossible for a computer to determine if an\narbitrary computer program and input will finish running or not.\n\n\nTo informally prove this, let's assume we have a function called \"does_it_halt\" which we can pass an arbitrary program and input to and have it\ntell us if the program will halt or loop indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nAssumption:\n \n\nThere exists a way for a computer to detect if any arbitrary program and input will halt or not.\n\n\n\n\nWith that assumption, let's assume someone wrote the following function as a simple way to utilize this knowledge:\n\n\nfunction does_it_halt(program, input) {\n    if (eventually halts)\n        return true;\n    else\n        return false;\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor simplicity's sake let's also say someone wrote wrapper for this function that passes the program as the input. Remember that our\ndoes_it_halt method is supposed to work on any arbitrary input, so passing in the memory location or text of a program works just fine.\n\n\nfunction debugApp(program) {\n    return does_it_halt(program, program);\n}\n\n\n\n\nAlright, hopefully you'll agree this is pretty straight forward. Now let's say someone really smart informed us that our does_it_halt function\ncouldn't possibly work, but we didn't believe him. As a result, he decided to write a cheeky little function called paradox that does the following:\n\n\nfunction paradox(program) {\n    if(debugApp(program))\n        while(1) {};\n    else\n        return true;\n}\n\necho debugApp(paradox);\n\n\n\n\nHa ha ha... so this dude wrote a function that puts itself into an intentional infinite loop if the does_it_halt says the program stops,\nand returns \"true\" if the program does not stop. Then he follows this up by calling our debug function on his code. \nSurely this is the most useless bit of code ever written right?\n\n\nWell, before we can answer that, we have to examine what happens when this dude calls debugApp(paradox).\n\n\nLet's say our debugApp() method returns true when passed Paradox. Let's logically think through what that means in terms of execution:\n\n\n\n\nFirst up, since \"echo debugApp(Paradox)\" returned True, that means that Paradox halts.\n\n\nIn the process of testing if Paradox halts, does_it_halt(), somewhere in its magical logic would have to run Paradox with the given input. That input is also a reference to Paradox. So the call to paradox would look like \"paradox(paradox)\".\n\n\nHowever, inside of Paradox is also a call to debugApp()! This call to \"debugApp(program)\" within Paradox would resolve to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" at runtime.\n\n\nIn order for does_it_halt to detect that Paradox halts, that means the call to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" within Paradox returns False, because otherwise Paradox would send itself into an infinite loop.\n\n\n\n\nUhh oh! Turns out that little piece of code wasn't as useless as we originally thought because it just proved that our does_it_halt function can't possibly exist as we've defined it.\nWe know from point #1 above that \"echo debugApp(Paradox)\" returns true, however, we also know that in order for that to happen, the call to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" as mentioned in point #4 above must return false. So two different calls to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" are returning differing results which is impossible. As such, our premise is proved false by what's called a Proof By Contradiction.\n\n\nThis problem (\"will a program halt\") which is unsolvable by computers by is known commonly as The Halting Problem. Alan Turing proved back in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve it is not possible.\n\n\nPost-Correspondance Problem (PCP)\n\n\nLet's say you have a list of some arbitrary number of dominoes which look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\nac\n\n\nb\n\n\na\n\n\na\n\n\nc\n\n\ncb\n\n\naa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncb\n\n\na\n\n\nbc\n\n\nba\n\n\nc\n\n\nac\n\n\nc\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want to have a computer tell you whether there's a way in which you can order the dominoes such that the sequence of the top row matches the sequence of the bottom row.\nHere's an example of a match where both the top and the bottom read \"abbcbba\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nbb\n\n\ncb\n\n\nba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabb\n\n\nc\n\n\nbb\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan a computer program be made for you that determines if there's a possible ordering that results in a match? The answer is \"no\". This is called the Post Correspondence Problem and was introduced by Emil Post back in 1946.\n\n\nPractically Uncomputable (with our current algorithms)\n\n\nP vs NP\n\n\n\"P\" are a class of problems for which their exists an algorithm to both find and verify an answer in polynomial time.\n\"NP\" (non-deterministic polynomial time) are a class of problems for which their exists algorithms to verify an answer in polynomial time, but \nmay or may not\n have algorithms to find an answer.\nNote the \"may or may not\" statement... P vs. NP is actually one of the biggest unknowns in Mathematics/CS because no-one has been able to prove definitively \nthat P = NP or that P != NP. \n\n\nIf P = NP, then that means there DOES exist polynomial time algorithms to solve problems we lump into this category, but that we just haven't found them yet. If P != NP, then that would confirm that no such polynomial time algorithms exist, and we could stop looking. There has been a 1 million dollar reward on the table since the year 2000 for anyone that can prove this one way or the other.\n\n\nx^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = A Polynomial\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of polynomials is that they can be fastly solved by computers. Equations can be generally clumped into one of three different groups:\n\n\ny = 1       // Constant time\ny = x       // Linear time\ny = x^2     // Polynomial time\ny = 2^x     // Exponential time\n\n\n\n\nThe problems we will be discussing which fall into this \"practically uncomputable\" category are \"NP\" problems for which we have no good algorithms to solve them. These are technically referred to as the \"NP-Complete\" class of problems, a term coined in the 1970s by researchers who realized that these problems are all essentially variations of the same thing, and if a solution could be found for one of them, it would mean all of them could in turn be solved.\n\n\nFor a good video on this topic, I'd recommend the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nBig-O Notation:\n\n\nWhen talking about computation a c",

            "text": "If you are software developer, you undoubtably have encountered infinite loops. Unlike interpretted\nlanguages such as PHP which will time out, lower level languages such as C++ will just keep running in an infinite loop forever if one exists.\nWith this in mind, it may seem like a good idea for someone to create a debugging program that detects those kinds of run-time errors in apps.\nHowever, you may be surprised to learn that  the reason why no such program exists is because it's impossible for a computer to determine if an\narbitrary computer program and input will finish running or not.  To informally prove this, let's assume we have a function called \"does_it_halt\" which we can pass an arbitrary program and input to and have it\ntell us if the program will halt or loop indefinitely.   Assumption:   \nThere exists a way for a computer to detect if any arbitrary program and input will halt or not.   With that assumption, let's assume someone wrote the following function as a simple way to utilize this knowledge:  function does_it_halt(program, input) {\n    if (eventually halts)\n        return true;\n    else\n        return false;\n}  For simplicity's sake let's also say someone wrote wrapper for this function that passes the program as the input. Remember that our\ndoes_it_halt method is supposed to work on any arbitrary input, so passing in the memory location or text of a program works just fine.  function debugApp(program) {\n    return does_it_halt(program, program);\n}  Alright, hopefully you'll agree this is pretty straight forward. Now let's say someone really smart informed us that our does_it_halt function\ncouldn't possibly work, but we didn't believe him. As a result, he decided to write a cheeky little function called paradox that does the following:  function paradox(program) {\n    if(debugApp(program))\n        while(1) {};\n    else\n        return true;\n}\n\necho debugApp(paradox);  Ha ha ha... so this dude wrote a function that puts itself into an intentional infinite loop if the does_it_halt says the program stops,\nand returns \"true\" if the program does not stop. Then he follows this up by calling our debug function on his code. \nSurely this is the most useless bit of code ever written right?  Well, before we can answer that, we have to examine what happens when this dude calls debugApp(paradox).  Let's say our debugApp() method returns true when passed Paradox. Let's logically think through what that means in terms of execution:   First up, since \"echo debugApp(Paradox)\" returned True, that means that Paradox halts.  In the process of testing if Paradox halts, does_it_halt(), somewhere in its magical logic would have to run Paradox with the given input. That input is also a reference to Paradox. So the call to paradox would look like \"paradox(paradox)\".  However, inside of Paradox is also a call to debugApp()! This call to \"debugApp(program)\" within Paradox would resolve to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" at runtime.  In order for does_it_halt to detect that Paradox halts, that means the call to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" within Paradox returns False, because otherwise Paradox would send itself into an infinite loop.   Uhh oh! Turns out that little piece of code wasn't as useless as we originally thought because it just proved that our does_it_halt function can't possibly exist as we've defined it.\nWe know from point #1 above that \"echo debugApp(Paradox)\" returns true, however, we also know that in order for that to happen, the call to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" as mentioned in point #4 above must return false. So two different calls to \"debugApp(Paradox)\" are returning differing results which is impossible. As such, our premise is proved false by what's called a Proof By Contradiction.  This problem (\"will a program halt\") which is unsolvable by computers by is known commonly as The Halting Problem. Alan Turing proved back in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve it is not possible.",

P vs. NP is actually one of the biggest unknowns in Mathematics/CS because no-one has been able to prove definitively \nthat P = NP or that P != NP.   If P = NP, then that means there DOES exist polynomial time algorithms to solve problems we lump into this category, but that we just haven't found them yet. If P != NP, then that would confirm that no such polynomial time algorithms exist, and we could stop looking. There has been a 1 million dollar reward on the table since the year 2000 for anyone that can prove this one way or the other.  x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = A Polynomial  The importance of polynomials is that they can be fastly solved by computers. Equations can be generally clumped into one of three different groups:  y = 1       // Constant time\ny = x       // Linear time\ny = x^2     // Polynomial time\ny = 2^x     // Exponential time  The problems we will be discussing which fall into this \"practically uncomputable\" category are \"NP\" problems for which we have no good algorithms to solve them. These are technically referred to as the \"NP-Complete\" class of problems, a term coined in the 1970s by researchers who realized that these problems are all essentially variations of the same thing, and if a solution could be found for one of them, it would mean all of them could in turn be solved.
