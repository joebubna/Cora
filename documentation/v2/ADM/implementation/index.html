<h1 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h1>
<p>Obviously a developer can dig through the code to see exactly how things work, but as that's a more extreme measure most people probably
don't bother with (and honestly ADM is kinda complicated),
here's the general understanding of how ADM is implemented. We'll start by talking about the ActiveRecord and Data-Mapper
patterns as those are an important segway into understanding the implementation of ADM.</p>
<h1 id="orm-basics">ORM Basics</h1>
<p>Alright, so first off, Object Relational Mapping only makes sense to use when you are doing object oriented programming. If you aren't familiar with OO programming,
I'd recommend you look into it, as it makes keeping your app well organized way easier. Assuming however that you have a basic understanding of what objects are,
let's discuss what an ORM does.</p>
<p>Say you have a simple User object that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="php">class User
{
    public $name;
    public $email;

    public function __construct($name, $email)
    {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
        $this-&gt;email = $email;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, each time someone makes a new request to your webapp, the application has to be reinitialized from scratch. This means any
data that's needed for your app to run must be fetched from various sources when setting up, and must be saved back to a permanent storage space after use (or
else the data will simply be thrown out and lost). Aside from data you only need to keep temporarily (Google 'php sessions tutorial'), anything you want
to store permanently you'll probably be saving to a database. If you've worked with objects in the past outside of a framework, your solution to saving an object
might have been to add a "save" method that executes some SQL (structured query language):</p>
<pre><code class="php">class User
{
    public $id;
    public $name;
    public $email;

    public function __construct($container, $name = null, $email = null)
    {
        $this-&gt;db = $container['db'];
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
        $this-&gt;email = $email;
    }

    public function save()
    {
        // If this user already exists in the DB, then just update it.
        if (isset($this-&gt;id)) {
            $this-&gt;db-&gt;query(&quot;UPDATE users SET name = :name, email = :email WHERE id = :user_id&quot;);
            $this-&gt;db-&gt;bind(':name', $this-&gt;name);
            $this-&gt;db-&gt;bind(':email', $this-&gt;email);
            $this-&gt;db-&gt;bind(':id', $this-&gt;id);
            $this-&gt;db-&gt;execute()
        }
        // Otherwise create a new user record.
        else {
            $db-&gt;query(&quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (NULL, :name, :email)&quot;);
            $this-&gt;db-&gt;bind(':name', $this-&gt;name);
            $this-&gt;db-&gt;bind(':email', $this-&gt;email);
            if ($this-&gt;db-&gt;execute()) {
                $this-&gt;id = $db-&gt;lastInsertId();
            }   
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we've changed the code to allow us to pass in a container with a database adaptor, and we either insert or update
a user in the database when the save() method is called. Already you can see that this is quickly adding a lot of lines of code
to our user model, and this is for a simple example which only contains a name and email. What's more, we haven't even added any code
yet for fetching users from the database! We only added code to save a user.</p>
<p>The goal of an ORM like ADM is to free you from having to implement methods to save and grab the model data from the database.
This not only allows you to get rid of a lot of code clutter from your classes, it also saves you time by freeing you from having
to implement error-prone, busy-work like writing all those SQL queries. Using ADM, your model and the controller code to create
a new user would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="php">class User extends \Cora\Model {

    public $model_attributes = [
        'id' =&gt; [],
        'name' =&gt; [],
        'email' =&gt; []
    ];

    public function __construct($name = null, $type = null)
    {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
        $this-&gt;type = $type;
    }
}


///////////////////////////////////////////
// Controller code to create a new user
///////////////////////////////////////////
class Users extends \MyApp {
    public function register()
    {
        $repo = \Cora\RepositoryFactory::make('User');
        $user = new User('testUser', 'testUser31@gmail.com');
        $repo-&gt;save($user);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's quickly discuss ActiveRecord vs. Data-Mapper implementations
which will then segway into how ADM is implemented in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="activerecord-pattern">ActiveRecord Pattern</h1>
<p>In terms of functionality, ActiveRecord basically works just like the example from the above section where I showed what your code might look like if you implemented
handling database persistance on your own. The difference being that your model will extend from a base class that handles the database related logic for you.
So you won't have to write (typically) the SQL queries to save your objects, but the logic will still be a part of your model. ActiveRecord generally looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="php">class User extends ActiveRecordModel
{
    public $name;
    public $email;

    public function __construct($name, $email)
    {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
        $this-&gt;email = $email;
    }
}

class ActiveRecordModel
{
    // Save record to database.
    public function save()
    {
        // SAVING TO DB LOGIC
    }

    // Fetch record from database.
    public function fetch($parameters)
    {
        // FETCHING FROM DB LOGIC
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's a few different main complaints people have about the ActiveRecord pattern, and they're all kinda interrelated. Let's start
by mentioning its lack of SRP adherance. SRP stands for Single Responsibility Principle, and basically means each class should only
handle a single part of a software's functionality. In doing so, you help your app stay logically sensible and readable, and make
testing easier. If software doesn't adhere to the SRP, then it runs the risk of becoming a confusing mess of spaghetti code that's hard
to test, hard to understand, hard to upgrade and maintain, etc.</p>
<p>This of course leads into and overlaps the other two main complaints about AR, those being that it can be hard to test (depends on just how much "magic"
happens under the surface) and that there's generally a lack of separation between the domain (aka 'the app logic') and the storage medium (database).
The testing issues usually are the result of "magic" in the form of data being passively fetched from a database, which if you're trying to test
your app independent of the storage medium, can obviously be frustrating. Similarly, the lack of domain/database separation also stems from how closely tied
to the database the ActiveRecord pattern is coupled by nature of how it works.</p>
<p>Why is important to keep the domain (app) logic decoupled from the database? Several reasons, the most important probably being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Storage mediums can and do change! You may be using the MySQL database today, but tomorrow you might need to use MongoDb, or save your data to
 XML files, or whatever. If you need to swap out the storage system your app uses, it shouldn't break all your code and force you to rewrite the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to be able to test and know that your code, your logic, works like you intend it to. Although most databases used nowadays aren't going
 to have a lot of obvious bugs, the fact of the matter remains that the storage layer is still powered by software, and as such, could have bugs
 in its implementation. That's why you need to be able to test YOUR code and know it's working, independent of any bugs related to the storage &amp; retrieval of data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the flip side, ActiveRecord's strengths are that it's super easy to use and requires little to no setup (which are awesome positives!). For these reasons, it's an extremely popular ORM
pattern used by many frameworks.</p>
<h1 id="data-mapper-pattern">Data-Mapper Pattern</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern">Data-Mapper pattern</a> utilizes a completely different approach from anything we've talked about so far.
When using a data mapper, your models are COMPLETELY SEPARATED from the storage layer. They don't know how to save themselves, or fetch records, or anything else, because
handling persistence to a storage medium is outside their responsibility! Using this pattern, it's the Data Mapper's job to know how to save and fetch objects.
It 'maps' different kinds of data used in your app to some sort of storage point. This
is obviously a complete 180 from the ActiveRecord pattern where objects have to know how to fetch and save from the storage layer themselves.</p>
<p>An ultra simplistic representation of the Data Mapper pattern might look like the below. Notice the User class doesn't extend anything, and a User object must
be passed in to the Data Mapper for it to save the user.</p>
<pre><code class="php">class User
{
    public $name;
    public $email;

    public function __construct($name, $email)
    {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
        $this-&gt;email = $email;
    }
}

class DataMapper
{
    // Save record to database.
    public function save($objectToBeSaved)
    {
        // SAVING TO DB LOGIC
    }

    // Fetch record from database. Some options are passed in to determine what to fetch.
    public function fetch($filterParameters)
    {
        // FETCHING FROM DB LOGIC
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As SRP purists will delight to tell you, the data mapper pattern adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle quite well. Furthermore, because an object
is simply an object and has nothing magical or special about it, this makes testing way more straightforword. Need to save an object to a different storage medium?
You have the option of just passing the object to a different data mapper! Need to map parts of your object to one storage medium, and another part of the same
object to a different storage location? Using Data Mapper you can write the functionality to handle this without adding all sorts of unrelated logical clutter to your models!
In these and other ways, the Data Mapper pattern is much more flexible than ActiveRecord.</p>
<p>The downsides to this Data Mapper pattern are that it can be a little hard to understand and use, and it can require more setup time and thought because it doesn't necessarily have the 1-to-1 type of relationship with a database many AR implementations possess.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-adms-implementation">Understanding ADM's Implementation</h1>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    WARNING: The following two paragraphs are chock-full of
    fancy terminology you may not understand. Don't freak out! Just keep reading
    and all will be explained by the end of this section.
</div>

<p>Alright, with the understandings from the previous section in place, we're now
ready to talk about how ADM implements object relational mapping. In short,
ADM uses a generalized Repository-Gateway-Factory design pattern where the
Gateway (which acts as the mapper between the domain and the persistence layer) asks
the model for various pieces of information about itself and the data it has ownership over.
The Gateway does this via the utility methods the Cora Model class provides. This
separation of concerns with the Gateway acting as the mapper between the persistence
layer and the domain, is in-line with using a Data Mapper and provides
you with all the benefits of that pattern.</p>
<p>However, ADM, as discussed previously, is not just a pure Data-Mapper implementation,
but instead a blend of both ActiveRecord and Data-Mapper. The goal of ADM is
to provide the ease of use ActiveRecord is famous for, but
also the separation of concerns and flexibility that Data Mapper excels at.
The way ADM accomplishes this is by using the repository-gateway-factory pattern
AND by having its models inherit methods from Cora's
Model class. This inheritance is obviously similar to ActiveRecord, however,
unlike AR, those methods do not directly interact with the persistence
layer. Instead, they help other classes (particularly the Gateway) understand and
use the attributes defined in the model. They also provide the model with
knowledge of the repository's existence, so the model can ask the repository to
fetch data dynamically (<a href="../../../../documentation/ADM/overview/#dynamic-loading">Click Here</a>
to read about how that works).</p>
<p>PHEWWW! Was that a mouthful or what? Hold on a sec, I think I need to cram a few
more buzzwords in those two paragraphs... Seriously though, now that's I've given
the highly compact description of how ADM works, let's slow down a bit and kinda
walk through it bit-by-bit.</p>
<p>So there's really two different logic flows that are important for understanding exactly
what's going on, the regular logic flow of fetching objects from a repository,
and the logic flow of fetching related objects dynamically. First let's look at
what happens when we want to fetch from a repository.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fetching-from-a-repository">Fetching from a Repository</h2>
<p><div class="subTitleH2">(typical Data-Mapper type implementation):</div></p>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>The Code (an example of a User repository in use within a Controller):</strong>   </p>
<pre><code class="php">// Repository Setup (if not using RepositoryFactory)
$db = \Cora\Database::getDb('name_of_db_connection');
$factory = new Factory('User');
$gateway = new Gateway($db);
$repo    = new Repository($gateway, $factory);

// Grab a user from repository. This triggers the logic flow seen in the diagram below.
$user = $repo-&gt;findBy('email', 'Bob@fakeEmail.com');
</code></pre>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>The Logic Flow Chart - Diagram A:</strong> <br />
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div></p>
<p><img alt="repository_pattern" src="../../../../img/repository_gateway_factory_pattern.png" /></p>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<p>As can be seen, there's nothing too fancy here. This is a normal looking Repository
pattern, where the Gateway is acting as our Data Mapper.
If you aren't familiar with it, here's a description of what the objects
responsibilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Repository:</strong> The Repository is the access point that parts of your application
interact with when they need to get objects out of, or save objects to, the persistence layer (usually a database).
If you create a "User" repository, it handles grabbing and saving Users, if you create an "Orders"
repository, it handles grabbing and saving Orders, and so forth.</li>
<li><strong>The Gateway:</strong> The Gateway is the class who's responsibility it is to interact directly
with the persistence layer and grab data from whatever database, or text file, or API,
it needs to interact with in order to get you the raw data you need. It also interacts
with the storage mediums to save objects when an object needs to be persisted.</li>
<li><strong>The Factory:</strong> The Factory is a class that makes objects. If you have a "User" factory,
then it's going to create User objects for you. In ADM, the Factory is given
the raw data (an array) from the Gateway and returns back objects.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Next let's look at the logic flow of fetching related objects dynamically. On the
surface this might seem like a small change (judging from the diagram), but really
it's much different as in this scenario a model itself is the one creating and
using a Repository (via the methods built into its Cora Model class parent).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dynamically-fetching-a-related-object">Dynamically Fetching a Related Object:</h2>
<p><div class="subTitleH2">(still Data-Mapping, but incorporates ActiveRecord type use of Cora Model class)</div></p>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>The Code (accessing a related object to a User):</strong>   </p>
<pre><code class="php">// Repository Setup (this time we're using RepositoryFactory)
$repo = \Cora\RepositoryFactory::make(User::class);

// Grab a user from repository. This triggers the logic flow seen in the diagram A.
$user = $repo-&gt;findBy('email', 'Bob@fakeEmail.com');

// Access a related object (Job is a class). This triggers the logic in diagram B below.
echo $user-&gt;job-&gt;title;
</code></pre>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>The Logic Flow Chart - Diagram B:</strong> <br />
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div></p>
<p><img alt="dynamic_pattern" src="../../../../img/dynamic_repository_gateway_factory_pattern.png" /></p>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The only difference between diagram A and diagram B above is how the repository
gets invoked (steps 0 through 1). However, this is actually a pretty major change
in the logic flow! When normally fetching from a repository, there's no interaction
with a model, a controller asks a repository for one or more objects and the
repository returns them. When a controller already has a Cora model and needs
to grab a related object, that's when the logic built into the Cora model class
kicks in to facilitate. The model looks at its own definition and any data passed
in when it was created, and from those determines how to create a Repository to
grab the needed related object. This is how ADM implements ActiveRecord like
simplicity in fetching objects, while still maintaining separation of concerns.
The model doesn't directly interact with the persistence layer (knowing that's not
its responsibility), but rather the Cora Model class gives it the necessary knowledge
on how to use the Repository system. And then, just to make sure testing doesn't get
difficult, options are included to disable Dynamic Fetching, or to pass in a
different database adaptor to override any defaults (I.E. force dynamic fetching to
use a test database). See <a href="../../../../documentation/v2/ADM/overview/#testing">Here</a>
for more information on testing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok, that's it! Hopefully you have a high level understanding of how ADM blends
together the best of Data-Mapper and ActiveRecord into a new best-of-both worlds system.</p></div>
